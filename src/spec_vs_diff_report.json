  "summary": "Diff adds a new MultiCharacterQuestionnaireDialog with family-role/gender grouping and integrates an entry point on CharactersPage. It also appears to add a React Query helper for creating multiple characters with cache invalidation, and includes a DRAFT_BUILD.md with build/test instructions. Several unrelated changes (book setup questionnaire integration, branding, backend access control/user profiles) are present but not requested.",
